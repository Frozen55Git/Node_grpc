# Cancellation

This example shows how clients can cancel in-flight RPCs by cancelling the
call object returned by the method invocation. The client will receive a status
with code `CANCELLED` and the server handler's call object will emit a
`'cancelled'` event.

## Start the server

```
node server.js
```

## Run the client

```
node client.js
```
